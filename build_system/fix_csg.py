"""Fix CSG files so they are valid, time-independent SCAD code

Strip out timestamps from import statements, because building
in CI/git-managed files means timestamps are unreliable.

Replace filenames of imports with the ones from the dependency file
as they are absolute and work even if the csg file is elsewhere.

Place a dependency fill beside the new file to allow Ninja figuring things out.
