# Sangaboard v0.5
[version 0.3]: https://kitspace.org/boards/gitlab.com/bath_open_instrumentation_group/sangaboard/sangaboard_v0.3/

We use a custom open source motor board called the Sangaboard. We have previously used [version 0.3], based on ATMEGA32 with Arduino-style programming. The latest version is based on the RP2040 chip from raspberry pi and works as a hat for the Pi, eliminating the need for additional wiring. The board provides power to the pi so that only one USB-C power supply is required (capable of at least 3A).

The Sangaboard uses surface mount components and custom boards, this makes it hard to solder your own. While the board is [open source], we do not recommend making your own unless you have the appropriate tools and experience. If you cannot get a Sangaboard, you can [build your own Sangaboard-compatible motor controller](../../workaround_motor_electronics/workaround_motor_electronics.md).

## Features
### Motor control
Like earlier versions, the Sangaboard reads commands via a serial connection and controls the motors driving the microscope stage. This is handled directly within the default microscope software.

### Microscope extension
To make use of more advanced features, Sangaboard extension to the microscope software has to be
installed. For more details and installation instructions, see [the extension repo](https://gitlab.com/filipayazi/sangaboard-extension/).

### Aborting moves
The new [firmware] supports aborting moves in progress. To abort a move, open the Sangaboard extension tab and use the Stop Stage button.

### 4th motor
This board can control 4 motors to support more complex variations of the microscope in the future. 4th motor control is not currently exposed within the standard microscope software, but microscope extensions can access it using `n_motors 4` command to enable the 4th motor and then sending move commands with 4 displacements. See [firmware] source for details.

### Illumination control
This new board can also control the illumination. In the most common configuration,
an LED on a carrier board is connected to the CC (constant current) +- pins on the
LED header. By default this will provide approximately 30mA of current for the LED.
The current for this LED can be controlled through the Sangaboard extension UI
in the range of 0-100 mA.

For higher power LEDs, there are 2 PWM based channels driven by MOSFETs on the board
and these are designed to provide up to 1A of current to the LEDs.
To protect the board from potential damage, there is 1.5 Ohm current limiting resisor
on in series with the PWM LEDs. For advanced users wishing to experiment with different
currents/LEDs, this resistor can be bypassed using a solder jumper on the bottom of
of board.
The PWM frequency and duty cycle (brightness) can be adjusted in the Sangaboard extension.
The freqency can be increased up to 1MHz if there is flicker visible in the recordings
(mostly at high framerates), but the brightness resolution is reduced at very high
frequencies (32 steps at 1MHz). In testing no flicker was visible even at much lower
frequencies. For extended use of the PWM system at high powers a heatsink is highly recommended.

### One-click firmware upgrades
The Sangaboard extensions allows the application of firware upgrades with a single button 
via the UI. Internally, this is handled by an SWD connection to the Raspberry Pi. If you
wish to use the pi's SWD for a different device, cut the cuttable traces between JP3 and JP4.
Cutting JP2 will disconnect the RP2040 reset pin from the Pi's GPIO23.

### Expansion header
Unused pins on the RP2040 are routed to the expansion header on the right side of the board.
This can be used to connect to any additional devices which can then be integrated to the firmware.
See the [board design and schematics] for more details on the wiring and the [firmware] for details
on how to add custom features.

### Stackable Pi header
To allow use of the available Raspberry Pi GPIO pins, the connector on the board is stackable
and all Pi's GPIO pins can be accessed. If you are using these pins to connect additional
components, avoid connecting anything that might draw too much current (the single power supply
is powering the pi, motors, and LED(s), so make sure total current does not exceed the rating
of your power supply). The USB-C connector on the board is rated for 5A. Additionally, GPIO14
and GPIO15 are used for serial communication and cannot be used for other components. GPIO23-25
are used for upgrading firmware, if you do not need this feature you can cut jumpers JP2-4 (see
section above for details).
