# Prepare the Arducam B0196 USB webcam for mounting 

This section describes how to prepare an Arducam B0196 USB camera module to use with versions of Openflexure optics modules. The Arducam B0196 module uses the same Sony IMX219 sensor as the Picamera V2.1, but gives a USB interface instaead of the Raspberry Pi camera interface. It is not supported in the Openflexure software, but it can be used with many simple webcam programs.

>! The camera sensor is very delicate  
>! Work in a dust-free area

* Take the protective film off the lens.
* Take the [Pi Camera lens tool]{qty: 1} and place it over the lens.
* Slowly unscrew the lens (About 4 full turns of the tool). There is some force required to start to unscrew the lens as it is held in place with a little glue.
* Carefully lift off the lens.
* Save the camera. Save the lens if you are going to use this camera with a lens spacer in the microscope.


>! **Caution!**

>! Attach the camera sensor to your optics module as soon as possible so that it does not collect dust 

The [prepared Arducam B0196 camera]{output, qty:1} and lens are now ready to attach to your optics module or lens spacer.
